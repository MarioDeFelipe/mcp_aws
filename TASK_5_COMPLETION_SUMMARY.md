## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Architecture**
```python
# Priority-based job scheduling
class SyncOrchestrator:
    - job_queue: PriorityQueue()           # Priority-ordered job queue
    - active_jobs: Dict[str, SyncJob]      # Currently running jobs
    - completed_jobs: List[SyncJob]        # Job history
    - sync_rules: Dict[str, SyncRule]      # Synchronization rules
    - executor: ThreadPoolExecutor         # Multi-threaded execution
    - metrics: SyncMetrics                 # Performance metrics
```

### **Job Priority System**
```python
class SyncPriority(Enum):
    CRITICAL = 1    # Real-time sync for analytical models
    HIGH = 2        # Hourly sync for views and core tables  
    MEDIUM = 3      # Daily sync for data flows
    LOW = 4         # Weekly sync for metadata updates
    MAINTENANCE = 5 # Manual/scheduled maintenance operations
```

### **Sync Frequency Options**
```python
class SyncFrequency(Enum):
    REAL_TIME = "real_time"      # Immediate sync
    EVERY_15_MIN = "every_15min" # Every 15 minutes
    HOURLY = "hourly"            # Every hour
    DAILY = "daily"              # Once per day
    WEEKLY = "weekly"            # Once per week
    MANUAL = "manual"            # Manual trigger only
```
