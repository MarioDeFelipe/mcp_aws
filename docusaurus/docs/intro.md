# Welcome to SAP Datasphere Sync

Advanced metadata synchronization between SAP Datasphere and AWS Glue Data Catalog with incremental sync and priority-based orchestration.

SAP Datasphere Sync is a comprehensive metadata synchronization solution that enables seamless data integration between SAP Datasphere and AWS Glue Data Catalog, preserving business context while enabling AWS analytics capabilities.

## What is SAP Datasphere Sync?

SAP Datasphere Sync is a metadata synchronization engine that bridges the gap between SAP Datasphere and AWS Glue Data Catalog. It enables organizations to:

- **Preserve Business Context**: Maintain business metadata, dimensions, measures, and hierarchies when synchronizing analytical models
- **Enable AWS Analytics**: Make SAP Datasphere data accessible to AWS analytics services while preserving data governance
- **Incremental Synchronization**: Efficiently sync only changed metadata to minimize data transfer and processing time
- **Priority-Based Orchestration**: Prioritize critical business assets like analytical models and core tables over views and data flows

The solution implements a three-environment architecture (Dog/Wolf/Bear) with comprehensive monitoring, audit trails, and enterprise-grade security through OAuth 2.0 and AWS IAM integration.

## Why SAP Datasphere Sync?

Organizations using both SAP Datasphere and AWS face several challenges when trying to leverage their data across platforms:

- **Metadata Silos**: Business context and metadata remain trapped in SAP Datasphere, making AWS analytics less effective
- **Manual Synchronization**: Time-consuming manual processes to keep metadata in sync between systems
- **Lost Business Context**: Technical metadata transfers without preserving business meaning, dimensions, and measures
- **Inconsistent Data Definitions**: Different naming conventions and data types across platforms create confusion

SAP Datasphere Sync solves these challenges by:

- **Automated Synchronization**: Intelligent, priority-based sync that handles critical business assets first
- **Business Context Preservation**: Maintains analytical models, dimensions, measures, and business metadata
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of naming conflicts and schema differences with configurable rules
- **Enterprise Security**: OAuth 2.0 integration with SAP and AWS IAM for secure, auditable operations
