# Enterprise Kiro Best Practices

This document outlines comprehensive best practices for deploying and managing Kiro in enterprise environments, ensuring security, scalability, and team collaboration.

## 1. Configuration Management & Governance

### Golden Configuration Strategy
- **Centralized Repository**: Maintain a dedicated "kiro-enterprise-config" repository with standardized configurations
- **Environment Separation**: Create separate configuration branches for dev, staging, and production
- **Template Library**: Develop reusable configuration templates for different team types (frontend, backend, DevOps, data)
- **Version Control**: Tag all configuration releases with semantic versioning

### Configuration Structure
```
kiro-enterprise-config/
├── environments/
│   ├── development/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── production/
├── templates/
│   ├── frontend-team/
│   ├── backend-team/
│   ├── devops-team/
│   └── data-team/
├── shared/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── steering/
│   └── mcp-servers/
└── docs/
```

### Deployment Process
1. **Configuration Review**: All changes require peer review and approval
2. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline validates configurations before deployment
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to dev → staging → production with validation gates
4. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to quickly revert to previous configurations

## 2. MCP Server Management

### Approved Server Registry
- **Curated Catalog**: Maintain enterprise-approved MCP servers with security assessments
- **Version Pinning**: Pin specific versions for stability and security compliance
- **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments of all MCP server dependencies
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Monitor and benchmark MCP server performance

### Server Categories
```json
{
  "enterprise-approved": {
    "aws-documentation": "awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@1.2.3",
    "aws-cdk": "awslabs.aws-cdk-mcp-server@2.1.0",
    "terraform": "awslabs.aws-terraform-mcp-server@1.5.2"
  },
  "team-specific": {
    "data-team": ["aws-bedrock-kb", "aws-serverless"],
    "devops-team": ["aws-cloudformation", "aws-terraform"],
    "security-team": ["aws-cdk"]
  }
}
```

### Access Control Matrix
| Role | AWS Docs | CDK | Terraform | Bedrock | CloudFormation |
|------|----------|-----|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Developer | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Senior Dev | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| DevOps | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Data Engineer | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |

## 3. Agent Hooks Standardization

   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Test coverage validation

2. **Deployment Automation**
   - Build validation before deployment
   - Automated rollback on failure
   - Environment-specific deployment checks

3. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Auto-update API documentation
   - Generate changelog from commits
   - Update README files based on code changes

## 4. Security & Compliance

### Credential Management

### Data Privacy & Protection
- **Data Classification**: Classify data sensitivity levels (public, internal, confidential, restricted)
- **PII Detection**: Automated detection and masking of personally identifiable information
- **Data Residency**: Ensure data processing complies with regional requirements
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest

### Network Security
```yaml
# Example security configuration
security:
  mcp_servers:
    network_policy: "restricted"
    allowed_domains: ["*.amazonaws.com", "api.company.com"]
    ssl_verification: true
    timeout: 30
  
  audit:
    log_level: "INFO"
    retention_days: 90
    export_format: "JSON"
    
  access_control:
    require_mfa: true
    session_timeout: 3600
    max_concurrent_sessions: 3
```
