# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a bidirectional data catalog and metadata synchronizing tool between SAP systems and AWS services. The tool will enable seamless data discovery, metadata management, and synchronization across SAP Datasphere, SAP HANA, and AWS data services like AWS Glue Data Catalog, Amazon S3, and other AWS analytics services. The solution will be containerized using Docker with comprehensive version control capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to synchronize metadata between SAP Datasphere and AWS Glue Data Catalog, so that I can maintain consistent data definitions across both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new table is created in SAP Datasphere THEN the system SHALL automatically create corresponding metadata entries in AWS Glue Data Catalog
2. WHEN metadata is updated in SAP Datasphere THEN the system SHALL propagate changes to AWS Glue Data Catalog within 5 minutes
3. WHEN a table is deleted in SAP Datasphere THEN the system SHALL mark the corresponding AWS Glue table as deprecated with proper versioning
4. IF metadata conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL log conflicts and provide resolution options through a web interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want bidirectional synchronization between AWS and SAP systems, so that changes made in either platform are reflected in both environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata is modified in AWS Glue Data Catalog THEN the system SHALL update corresponding SAP Datasphere objects
2. WHEN new data sources are added to AWS S3 THEN the system SHALL create external table definitions in SAP Datasphere
3. WHEN schema changes occur in either system THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and sync changes
4. IF bidirectional conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL implement configurable conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, manual resolution, or merge)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the synchronization tool deployed as a Docker container with version control, so that I can manage deployments and rollbacks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the tool THEN the system SHALL run as a containerized application using Docker
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL support hot-reload without service interruption
3. WHEN updates are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and support rollback capabilities
4. IF the container fails THEN the system SHALL automatically restart and resume synchronization from the last checkpoint

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data governance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and monitoring, so that I can track all metadata changes and ensure compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any metadata operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamp, user, and change details
2. WHEN synchronization errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and detailed error reports
3. WHEN compliance audits are required THEN the system SHALL provide exportable audit logs in standard formats
4. IF data lineage tracking is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between SAP and AWS data objects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure authentication and authorization, so that only authorized users can access and modify metadata synchronization settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL authenticate using OAuth 2.0 or SAML integration
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL validate API keys and enforce rate limiting
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require multi-factor authentication
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block suspicious activities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want real-time data discovery capabilities, so that I can find and access data across both SAP and AWS environments from a unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for data assets THEN the system SHALL provide unified search across SAP and AWS catalogs
2. WHEN data lineage is requested THEN the system SHALL display end-to-end data flow visualization
3. WHEN data quality metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL aggregate quality scores from both platforms
4. IF data access permissions are required THEN the system SHALL display current access rights and request workflows

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a solution architect, I want configurable mapping rules and transformation logic, so that I can customize how metadata is synchronized between different system schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up synchronization THEN the system SHALL allow custom field mapping configurations
2. WHEN data types differ between systems THEN the system SHALL apply configurable transformation rules
3. WHEN business rules change THEN the system SHALL support dynamic rule updates without system restart
4. IF mapping validation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide preview and testing capabilities for mapping rules

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want a professional and intuitive web interface, so that I can efficiently manage data synchronization operations with confidence and ease.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a modern, responsive design with enterprise-grade styling
2. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL provide consistent branding, professional color schemes, and intuitive navigation patterns
3. WHEN performing operations THEN the system SHALL show clear status indicators, progress bars, and professional confirmation dialogs
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance and professional styling
5. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN the system SHALL present data using professional charts, tables, and visualizations with corporate design standards
6. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain professional appearance and full functionality across all screen sizes
7. WHEN customizing the interface THEN the system SHALL allow white-label branding options including logos, colors, and company-specific themes
