# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a metadata synchronization tool between SAP Datasphere and AWS Glue Data Catalog. The tool will enable seamless metadata discovery, business context preservation, and bidirectional synchronization of data assets including tables, analytical models, views, and business metadata. The solution leverages a three-environment architecture (Dog/Wolf/Bear) with MCP server integration and OAuth authentication for enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to synchronize core metadata assets between SAP Datasphere and AWS Glue Data Catalog, so that I can maintain consistent data definitions and enable AWS analytics on Datasphere data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new table is created in Datasphere THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL create corresponding table metadata in Glue_Data_Catalog with schema mapping
2. WHEN an Analytical_Model is published in Datasphere THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL create business-ready table definitions in Glue_Data_Catalog with preserved business context
3. WHEN a view is created in Datasphere THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL create external table definitions in Glue_Data_Catalog with view metadata
4. WHEN a space is created in Datasphere THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL create corresponding database in Glue_Data_Catalog with proper naming conventions
5. IF schema changes occur in Datasphere THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL validate compatibility and update Glue_Data_Catalog within 15 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want priority-based synchronization with conflict resolution, so that critical business assets are synchronized first and conflicts are resolved according to business rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synchronizing metadata THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL prioritize Analytical_Models and core tables over views and data flows
2. WHEN naming conflicts occur THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL apply configurable naming conventions with environment prefixes
3. WHEN schema conflicts arise THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL implement source-system-wins strategy with conflict logging
4. WHEN business metadata differs THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL merge descriptions and preserve both technical and business context
5. IF critical synchronization errors occur THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL halt sync operations and generate detailed error reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a three-environment deployment architecture with MCP server integration, so that I can develop, test, and deploy metadata synchronization with proper isolation and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the Dog_Environment SHALL provide containerized Flask application with mock data and hot-reload capabilities
2. WHEN testing THEN the Wolf_Environment SHALL provide FastAPI application with real Datasphere OAuth integration for validation
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the Bear_Environment SHALL provide AWS Lambda serverless deployment with auto-scaling
4. WHEN accessing via AI tools THEN the MCP_Server SHALL expose metadata operations through standardized Model Context Protocol
5. IF environment failures occur THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL implement automatic failover and checkpoint recovery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data governance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and data lineage tracking, so that I can monitor metadata synchronization operations and maintain compliance across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any metadata synchronization occurs THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL log operation details with timestamp, source system, target system, and change summary
2. WHEN Analytical_Models are synchronized THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL preserve and track business context, dimensions, measures, and hierarchies
3. WHEN data lineage is requested THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL provide end-to-end traceability between Datasphere objects and Glue_Data_Catalog entries
4. WHEN compliance audits are required THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL export audit logs in JSON and CSV formats with filtering capabilities
5. IF synchronization errors occur THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL generate structured error reports with remediation suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want OAuth 2.0 authentication with environment-specific security controls, so that metadata synchronization operations are secure and properly authorized across all deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Datasphere THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL authenticate using OAuth 2.0 with environment-specific client credentials
2. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL use IAM roles with least-privilege permissions for Glue_Data_Catalog operations
3. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL implement exponential backoff and request throttling
4. WHEN security tokens expire THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL automatically refresh OAuth tokens without service interruption
5. IF unauthorized access is detected THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL log security events and temporarily suspend operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want unified metadata discovery with business context preservation, so that I can find and understand data assets across both Datasphere and AWS environments with their business meaning intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for data assets THEN the MCP_Server SHALL provide unified search across Datasphere spaces and Glue_Data_Catalog databases
2. WHEN viewing Analytical_Models THEN the MCP_Server SHALL display business names, descriptions, dimensions, measures, and hierarchies
3. WHEN exploring data lineage THEN the MCP_Server SHALL show relationships between Datasphere objects and their corresponding Glue_Data_Catalog entries
4. WHEN accessing synchronized metadata THEN the MCP_Server SHALL preserve original business context including steward information and certification status
5. IF metadata is missing or incomplete THEN the MCP_Server SHALL indicate synchronization status and provide refresh capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a solution architect, I want configurable synchronization rules with asset-specific mapping strategies, so that I can customize how different metadata types are transformed and synchronized between Datasphere and AWS Glue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring space-to-database mapping THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL support custom naming conventions and environment prefixes
2. WHEN synchronizing data types THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL apply configurable type mapping rules between Datasphere and Glue_Data_Catalog schemas
3. WHEN handling Analytical_Models THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL preserve business metadata through configurable business-to-technical field mappings
4. WHEN mapping validation is required THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL provide preview mode with dry-run capabilities and impact analysis
5. IF mapping rules are updated THEN the Metadata_Sync_Engine SHALL support hot-reload of configuration without service restart

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want environment-specific web interfaces with synchronization monitoring, so that I can manage metadata operations across development, testing, and production environments with appropriate controls and visibility.

1. WHEN accessing Dog_Environment THEN the web interface SHALL provide development-friendly features including mock data exploration and API testing capabilities
2. WHEN using Wolf_Environment THEN the web interface SHALL display real-time Datasphere connectivity status and metadata extraction results
3. WHEN monitoring Bear_Environment THEN the web interface SHALL show production metrics including sync performance, error rates, and system health
4. WHEN viewing synchronization status THEN the web interface SHALL display asset-level sync progress with priority indicators and business impact assessment
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the web interface SHALL provide environment-specific troubleshooting guidance and escalation workflows
6. WHEN managing configurations THEN the web interface SHALL support environment promotion with validation and approval workflows
7. IF mobile access is required THEN the web interface SHALL maintain full functionality across all screen sizes with responsive design
